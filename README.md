# Sudoku Solver
Simple application written in HTML and JavaScript to watch a Sudoku puzzle solve itself.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo or download a zip.
2. Using a modern browser, open index.html.
3. Make sure the solver loads and draws an input grid.
4. Try entering a Sudoku puzzle into the text fields and hit "Begin".

## Development
* Development is done with Eclipse 4.7.2 with "HTML Editor (WTP)".
* Indentation is 2 spaces for CSS/JS files and 4 spaces for HTML files.
* Use ECMA2015, because Eclipse can't figure out how to format ES6.

### TODOs:
* Streamline the UI for data entry and retrieval, move buttons around.
* Refactor all the matrix operations into one file.
* Investigate an adjustment to the cross-number exclusion theorem, I think there's edge cases I'm forgetting.

## Algorithm
TODO: Paraphrase the comments in solver.js to describe the algorithm.
