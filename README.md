# Sudoku Solver
Simple application written in HTML and JavaScript to watch a Sudoku puzzle solve itself.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo or download a zip.
2. Using a modern browser, open index.html.
3. Make sure the solver loads and draws an input grid.
4. Try entering a Sudoku puzzle into the text fields and hit "Begin".

## Development
* Development is done with Eclipse 4.7.2 with "HTML Editor (WTP)".
* Indentation is 2 spaces for CSS/JS files and 4 spaces for HTML files.

The file `program.js` has a spot commented out where you can hard-code a puzzle so you don't have to re-type the puzzle each time you refresh the browser during development.

### TODOs:
* Add the tricky bitmask checking algorithm.
* Streamline the UI for data entry and retrieval.

## Algorithm
TODO: Paraphrase the comments in solver.js to describe the algorithm.
